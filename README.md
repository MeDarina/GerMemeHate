# GerMemeHate
Hateful memes constitute an important part of online harassment, but are challenging due to their visio-linguistic nature and because annotated datasets are rare for languages other than English. We present GerMemeHate, a parallel dataset of memes translated from English. We describe the annotation process, analyze the resulting dataset, and evaluate how well English detection models can be transferred to German. Translatetion are based on the Facebook Meme Challenge Dataset (Kiela et al. 2020).
